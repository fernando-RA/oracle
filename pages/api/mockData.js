I believe many aspects of consciousness, such as the awareness of color, sound and pain can be described in terms of the data sent through the thalamus, which creates the awareness of the qualia (the sensory inputs often being confused with the qualia themselves). This is somewhat similar to the way in which an image of a rose would be found in a encyclopedia. Human language conflates the concepts of data, information, and qualia as if they were the same because they are all aspects of experiences. But from the perspective of data acquisition, storage, and transmission, brains and computers differ only in amount and complexity, not metaphysically.",
